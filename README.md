# Vanilla PHP API (WIP)

This repository is a work in progress for building a **fast and secured API using nothing but vanilla PHP**. The primary goal of this project is to practice and enhance my core PHP skills by constructing an API from the ground up, without relying on frameworks or external libraries.

---

## About the Project

This API is being developed to demonstrate the capabilities of vanilla PHP in building a robust backend. It aims to showcase how to structure an application efficiently using fundamental PHP concepts.

---

## Current Components

- **Models**: Define the structure and relationships of data.
- **Services**: Handle the business logic and interactions with data.
- **Database**: Utilizes **PDO with SQLite** for data persistence.
- **Controllers**: Manage incoming requests and orchestrate responses.

---

## Goals

- **Speed**: Optimize the API for high performance and quick response times.
- **Security**: Implement robust security measures to protect against common vulnerabilities.
- **Vanilla PHP**: Achieve all functionalities using only core PHP features.

## Usage

_Instructions for setting up and running the API will be provided here once the project reaches a more stable state._

```bash
php index.php
```
